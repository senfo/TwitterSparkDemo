A simple demo project for demonstrating Spark's streaming API using Twitter
data. I am a C#, JavaScript, Ruby convert and new to Spark, so I expect
criticism of some sort. Since this is intended to be used by others who are also
new to Spark, please feel free to submit pull requests to improve upon the
quality of the project.
